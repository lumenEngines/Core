      "summary": "1. This file contains CSS styles for an image tracing component, likely used in a web application or website. It styles various elements such as the container, toolbar, canvas, buttons, and file upload input.\n\n2. Key components/sections:\n   - .container (Styles for the main container)\n   - .tracer-title (Styles for the title)\n   - .toolbar (Styles for the toolbar with buttons)\n   - .canvas-container (Styles for the canvas container)\n   - .file-upload-container (Styles for the file upload input)\n   - .results (Styles for the results section)\n\n3. There are no dependencies or imports used in this file, as it is a CSS file.\n\n4. Based on the class names and styles, this file seems to be part of a larger project that involves image tracing or manipulation. The styles suggest that the component allows users to upload an image, interact with a canvas, use various tools/buttons, and display results or traced paths. It likely works in conjunction with JavaScript code to provide the functionality.",

      "summary": "1. This file defines a React component called `Visualizer` that renders a container with a title \"Visualizer\" and a message \"Coming Soon\".\n\n2. Key components:\n   - `Visualizer`: The main and only component defined in this file.\n\n3. Dependencies and imports:\n   - `React`: The React library is imported to enable the use of React components.\n   - `./Visualizer.css`: A CSS file is imported to style the `Visualizer` component.\n\n4. Based on the file's location (`/src/components/`) and the naming convention, it seems that this file is part of a larger React application. The `Visualizer` component is likely intended to be a placeholder or a future feature related to data visualization or some kind of visual representation. However, without more context from the rest of the project, it's difficult to determine its exact role.",
